# 🧠 Real-Time AI Attention & Fatigue Monitoring Web Application

A full-stack AI-powered web application that monitors user attention levels in real-time using computer vision and facial landmark analysis.

Built using Flask, OpenCV, MediaPipe, Pandas, and Docker.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This system analyzes facial landmarks from a live webcam feed to:

- Detect blinks using Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR)
- Identify distraction based on head deviation
- Detect fatigue through prolonged eye closure
- Calculate a real-time attention score
- Log session data for analytics
- Generate attention graphs
- Export session data as CSV
- Run inside a Docker container

The application provides a live dashboard and a post-session analytics report.

## 🏗️ System Architecture

```

Webcam → OpenCV → MediaPipe FaceMesh → Feature Extraction →
Scoring Engine → Flask Backend → Web Dashboard →
Analytics Engine → Graph + CSV Export

```

---

## 🧠 Core Features

### 1️⃣ Real-Time Facial Landmark Detection
Uses MediaPipe FaceMesh to detect 468 facial landmarks per frame.

---

### 2️⃣ Blink Detection (Eye Aspect Ratio - EAR)

EAR formula:

EAR = (||p2 − p6|| + ||p3 − p5||) / (2 × ||p1 − p4||)

Used to detect:
- Normal blinking
- Prolonged eye closure (fatigue)

---

### 3️⃣ Distraction Detection

Head deviation calculated using nose landmark relative to frame center.

If deviation persists for multiple frames → marked as distracted.

---

### 4️⃣ Fatigue Detection

If eyes remain closed beyond threshold duration → fatigue event recorded.

---

### 5️⃣ Attention Scoring Engine

Attention score is calculated based on:

- Blink behavior
- Distraction detection
- Fatigue detection

Smoothed using exponential smoothing:

```

display_score = 0.8 * previous + 0.2 * current

```

---

### 6️⃣ Session Analytics

At the end of a session:

- Session duration
- Average attention score
- Total blinks
- Fatigue events
- Percentage time distracted
- Attention vs Time graph
- CSV export

---

## 🌐 Web Application Features

- Live video streaming via Flask
- REST endpoint for real-time stats
- Summary dashboard page
- Graph generation (Matplotlib)
- CSV report download
- Clean dark UI

---

## 📦 Docker Support

The application is fully containerized.

### Build Docker Image

```

docker build -t attention-system .

```

### Run Container

```

docker run -p 5000:5000 attention-system

```

Access:

```

[http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)

```

⚠ Note: Webcam access inside Docker may not work on Windows due to device isolation.
